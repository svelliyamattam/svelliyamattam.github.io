# Sharath Velliyamattam's Portfolio
Thank you for viewing my website. My name is Sharath Velliyamattam, and I am currently a master's student at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). I am currently pursuing Applied Biomedical Engineering degree at the time I am creating this website. This website is currently under construction and will be updated monthly to document my life's progress.
